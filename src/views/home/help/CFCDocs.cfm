<h3>CFC API Documentation</h3>
<p>
This section is the actual live documentation of your framework installation.  The default view is  for the
core components.
</p>

<p>
You can switch to the various component sections: Beans, Plugins, and Util to render their live documentation.
This is a great way to learn about the ColdBox framework. Ohh, and by the way, it is using the <b>cfcViewer</b> Plugin
to generate all the documentation.
