<h3>ColdBox Conventions</h3>
<p>
Please be very careful when changing these settings as your applications WILL FAIL!! Only do this if you really want to 
change the framework-wide conventions. If you do this then you will have to rename the folders of existing applications
that use framework-wide conventions. You can also override conventions locally on a per application basis. Please
see the online help on how to do this.
