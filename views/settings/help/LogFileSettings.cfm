<h3>Log File Settings</h3><p>In this screen you can modify ColdBox's logging facility parameters.  You can change the default log location per application, file encoding, the buffer size for the logger and the maximum size in kbytes for the auto-archiving of the log files.<h3>Default Log Directory</h3><p>This is the default directory name that will be used to store the ColdBox log files if there is none provided in the config file.</p><h3>Log File Encoding</h3><p>From here you can choose the type of encoding the file will be creating in. The default is UTF-8.</p><h3>Log File Buffer Size</h3><p>The file buffer size is used by the StringBuffer java class. The minimum is 8192 bytes and the maximum is 64000 bytes.This value can increase the performance of the logging facility.</p><h3>Log File Maximum Size</h3><p>This is the maximum file size in kbytes of the running coldbox log file. This size is checked by the framework once an entry issubmitted. Once this maximum threshold is reached, ColdBox will auto-archive the log file by creating a gzip archive andcreating a new rotation log file.</p></p>
